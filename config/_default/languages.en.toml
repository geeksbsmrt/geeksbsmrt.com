headline = "My name's Adam, and for the better part of two decades, I've been working in support and on-premises IT engineering. Making things work, keeping them secure, and automating them as much as possible. Why? Buttons and humans. I hate buttons, especially those my wife and kids love to push. Then there are the humans. And no, I don't hate humans. However, they are error prone, and any IT professional will tell you, users are the most error prone humans on the planet. Automation minimizes both."
