## Let's Git InIT

To *Git* where I'm *head*-ed, we need to go back in *history*. My first *commit*-ments were in user support, and as so many do, laid the framework for my career. From there, I *branched* into client engineering, automating operating system and application deployments. I *fetch*-ed a Bachelor of Science degree in mobile development, though I *stashed* most of those skills for a long time. The next *fork* brought me to infrastructure engineering, *cherry-pick*-ing Microsoft technologies. Now, I develop and *push* platforms to our support teams. I'm looking for a way to *merge* all of my skills and *rebase* my career.

That was really punny, but I can't help it, I'm a dad. We always have the best yokes, not jokes, because they're easy to crack, like eggs.

I know many of you are now channeling your inner Dave Matthews and asking 'Where are you going?' So I'll get to the *point*-ers.

## Where Am I?

What I've done, other than continue to use music references (thanks Linkin Park), is setup a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) to run my home network and hosting. I've installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to containerize services making changes and re-deployment easy. It also strengthens my Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) skills. It's perfect for running my DHCP\DNS through [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/) and [Unbound](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/), a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) monitoring stack, a few [GitHub](https://github.com/) Actions runners, and this website.

Check back for posts about the setup, configuration, and management of these services.

## Where Am I Going?

### Getting My Head in the Cloud

My career path, focusing on End User Compute within companies heavily invested in on-prem infrastructure, means my cloud skills haven't kept pace. I plan on leveraging my strengths in Microsoft technologies to explore Azure, Entra, and associated services. I'll be focusing on the automation of these services with PowerShell and Bicep. I'd also like explore Ansible, Terraform, and other IaC platforms.

### Getting Myself into the Community

For much of my career, I've used many open-source or open-core products. I've learned so much from blogs, YouTube, and other community platforms. I want to start giving back to the community that's given so much to me. Since my strongest language is PowerShell, modules and distributable scripts make sense. I'll dig deeper into PowerShell's advanced functionalities like the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Transformation Classes, Argument Completers, and more. I may even try to pick up .Net to contribute to PowerShell source directly.

## How I'm Getting There

The answer to this question isn't as straight forward. There's a lot of learning, trials, and errors ahead. This blog will contain the hi-lights, lo-lights, and de-lights of my journey.

Stay *InTune*-d.
